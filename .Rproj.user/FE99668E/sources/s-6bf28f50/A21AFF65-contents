__perceptable__ ; why? Well:  

1)  By [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/perceptive), to be _perceptive_ is to understand what you are looking at and derive insight. That is both the goal for the functions of this package, and that of the users trying to translate their data's story for others.  
2)  It's hard to name packages... especially when trying to force a homophone.  
3)  See #2 and add to it that we seem to enjoy forcing an **"R"** somewhere into all our languages open-source libraries
